(*) CC1101, NRF24, W5500 use the same pinouts, need to add a switch on CS and CE/GDO0 to choose which to use.

ESP32-C5 doesn't support USB-OTG, for BadUSB you need to use a CH9329 module

FM Radio, PN532 on I2C, other I2C devices, CH9329, shared with GPS Serial interface.
I2C SDA: 4
I2C SCL: 5

Serial interface to other devices (Flipper)
Serial Tx: 11
Serial Rx: 12
